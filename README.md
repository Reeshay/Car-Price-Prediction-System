Car Price Prediction

This project aims to predict the market price of cars based on various features such as year, make, model, engine size, mileage, and transmission type. It uses machine learning models to build a predictive model that estimates car prices, helping both buyers and sellers gauge the fair value of a vehicle.

Key Features:

Data Collection: The dataset includes car attributes like engine size, mileage, fuel type, and registration details.

Modeling: The project employs multiple machine learning models including:

Linear Regression: A simple model for predicting car prices based on a linear relationship with features.

Random Forest: A more advanced model that improves accuracy by averaging predictions from multiple decision trees.

Decision Tree: A model that splits data based on feature values to predict car prices.

Model Evaluation: Performance is evaluated using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE) to assess prediction accuracy.

Features Used:

Car make and model

Year of manufacture

Engine size and fuel type

Transmission type

Mileage

City of registration

Objective:

To build a robust machine learning model that accurately predicts car prices and aids users in making informed decisions during the buying and selling process
